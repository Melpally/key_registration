# key_registration
A web application for registration of keys in a dormitory
This program automates the process of key registration. Previously, to register a key, when students were taking or returning a key to their room in the dormitory, they had to record the time and their id in an old-fashioned paper notebook with a pen. This web application that uses Flask framework, will allow the students to register the keys online via a QR-code.
